# Basic_chatbot

This is a basic chatbot that reacts to your messages. You can use this as a backbone. If you want to create a more advanced chatbot, try setting up your own database or using an AI API to integrate with it. Alternatively, you could create a simple application.

Note: This is a backup file for myself.
